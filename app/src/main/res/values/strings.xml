    <string name="intro">Ware—Your personal database for keeping your watch and read lists. \n\nWare came from the words watchlist and readlist. “Wa” from watch and “re” from read. This is a revamped notes app dedicated to people who are fond of watching movies/series/dramas and reading books, also called bookworms. This is an application that makes it easier for users to keep track of the things they want to watch and read.</string>
